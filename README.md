# Anupama’s Portfolio — Windows XP Edition

I grew up on a Pentium III running Windows XP—where my love for computers and building things began. This portfolio is a playful homage to that era: classic XP look, modern web under the hood. Huge credit to Microsoft for the original design and inspiration. Enjoy!

- Launch apps from desktop icons or the Start menu
